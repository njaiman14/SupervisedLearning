It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch.  It's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months, the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside.

All of this is nothing compared to the time when it became necessary to replace the battery (less than one year with both watches).  I didn't have the necessary special tools to replace the battery.  Replacing the battery was a major accomplishment. I could not get the first watch to work after replacing the battery.

I had mine for six weeks, worn as a normal watch(at my inside job), and the case was scratched and dinged as if it was 10 years old.

Expect to spend 20 bucks a year sending it back for replacement.I forgot to mention som4ething. When I sent the watch back after having it for six months, the band had broken. The rubber tore where it attached to the case---and that was simply from taking the watch off. No bike crashes, no playing sports. Just removing it. At that time, the yellow in the engraved Lance Armstrong signature on the case back had also come off. As a matter of fact, it actually stuck to my wrist.

Given that the electronics in this thing must weigh nothing, it's obvious that Nike has packed the case with redundant chunks of metal to make it so heavy. Just wearing it for a day gives your arm a workout! However, if you're in the market for an eye-catching big digital watch that has a clear display with large numerals that shows all the basic information (time, seconds, date), that's fairly affordable then this might be the one for you.If you want a similar watch that's not so big, check out the Nike Blade watch - the styling is less dramatic, but it won't break your wrist to the same degree.\", \"Very disappointed about this product. I've had it just few months and the metal around the front came off and I've not even exposed the watch to water or anything, even though it's supposed to be water resistant. You can tell that the metal was not glued properly to begin with.

My main complaint, is that the buttons are really sensitive.  Half the time I look at my watch it says 4:00 AM (which is the time I have my alarm set to).

This has become really annoying', \"I got this for my birthday and a little over a year later it was useless.  The plastic/rubber watch strap just corroded away and broke off.  I went to the Nike Store to get a new strap and they said try a sporting goods store.  Went to a couple and couldn't find any place that sold replacement straps.  I searched the internet high and low and eventually found Parsec Ent.  They sent me a strap for $23.95 (rip off) only to find out that it is impossible to replace the strap.

The band broke, and because of the way that the band is part of the watch, it cannot be replaced.  There was no sudden strike that caused the break.  It just basically wore out.

You can tell the time from almost any crazy angle and the print on the watch is very large.  The band has a very weird, unique design in that it buckles off-center, which seems to work very well for this watch.  Though the metal clip to hold the band down is annoying while typing.  It has a 100-track record which is more than enough for me and the data even allows you to modify results with distances for record tracking.This watch is near perfection.  There was only one thing wrong...Every time I bend my wrist, it hits the \"mode\" button.  This means every time I look at my watch I am in Chronology or Counter mode.  It just won\\'t stay in time mode no matter what I\\'m doing.So, I\\'m taking it back.  I\\'ve had other Triax\\'s before and none of them have done this.

This watch is so small, I'm on the last notch.The wriststrap is the smallest of any of the Nike watches I ever owned. I would strongly advise you to get the midsize 100 version if you are looking for a normal man's watch. I was sorely disappointed.The lighting is subpar and not terribly bright. For some reason, nike decided to reverse the lighting, causing the watch face to go dimmer.I had high expectations since this is my second nike watch.

Something about walking on a bubble of air always fascinated me. But this year I think Nike missed the mark. The most obvious change is to the tongue of the shoe. Or whatever this thing is called. It's extremely thin made of some type of nylon. Reminds me of the same material rain jackets are made of. It's so thin I have doubts it will last very long. Its like a flap of fabric, no cushion to it at all. The tongue is so thin and small that I have a hard time grabbing the thing when pulling them on me feet.  I typically buy new Nike once a year. But the feel of these shoes does not instill confidence in me that they will make the entire year. Maybe it's just me. But I feel prior versions were made of better material. I will keep them simply because I need new shoes. But if I had seen these in the store before I made my purchase online, I probably would have chosen a different year model. Don't get me wrong, they are still Nike Air max. And if you wear Nike as much as I wear Nike,  then they will do just fine. I just don't like them compared to prior versions and I think the tongue is a cheap thin piece of ----. That's my two cents.

They last 9 months to a year of almost daily use.  They have a very stiff sole which gives you the support you need while running or walking.  Test your shoes by trying to bend them in half.  If they bend, that means there is very little support and your foot isn't suppose to bend that way.  These Nikes never bend and are super firm.  Run on my friends.  Run on.\", \"I'm in my 50s and run 3 times/week, 2 to 4 miles. These provide nice cushioning for my knees, even running on asphalt. At this distance, they last almost a year.

The bit of rubber that comes up on the front of the toe is wider on one shoe than the other, and it's slightly off-center.

I am giving the watch 3 stars to be fair.  I am returning the watch after all for other reasons so I can't really speak of it's efficiency, but I had a hard time trying to get the intervals set up which was the main reason I bought it.

I found it a little awkward trying to secure the excess of the band, but I suppose this might be something easily adaptable to after frequent use.

I measured the shoes against my other Nike shoes, and they are definitely shorter.  Buyers beware.... See return policy before you buy!!!\", \"Cheaply made or bad design? The front of the toe is to thin for tennis and the stitched front seam split wide open! The same thing happened to another teammate of my son's tennis team who had the same shoe!

However, the height of the shoe is just-precisely wrong.  The top rubs against the ankle so that any active wear will cause blisters, sores, or broken skin.  Also, I've almost twisted my ankle a couple times: possibly this is a center-of-gravity issue for a shoe raised too high, or maybe I just need to get used to it.  I don't think I'd buy these shoes again.

My regular bra size is 38DD however in this size it was way too small.

I usually wear size 7 flip flops and found the fit to be alright with thin sports socks. If I could choose again I would have gone with size 8.5 because the tip of the shoes are narrow while my feet are a bit broad.The shoe feels solid and I think it is much better as a walking shoe than a running or sprinting shoe. This is because of its solid construct and inflexibility. A website says it weighs 6oz but it somehow feels heavier than the Nike Zoom Waffle Racer V men's shoes (7.5oz based on size 9) that I just bought.The soles of the shoe are made up of little squares which wore out quickly and which provide insufficient grip on wet surfaces. I do not need to be as cautious sprinting on dry gravel as I am on wet gravel. But on dry gravel I can still feel the lack of traction. When it is raining or has rained I do not dare to go hard on sprints and cannot go hard anyway because I can feel the shoes slipping instead of gripping.I do not jog or do endurance running in these shoes and they seem to have worn out pretty quickly.

This little device helped motivate me to run farther.  One thing I was worried about at first was that my running shoes (also nike) didn't have the little nike plus insert in them.

Also, you can log into nike's site and it can track your runs, and you can join different activities.  I joined groups like 30 miles in 30 days or 365 miles in 365 days.  Every time you logged in it would track your runs and load them into your profile so that you wcould see you were closer to that goal.  It also has the capability to sync your runs to your facebook page.  This feature kept me running.  Sometimes if I had a crappy day and didn't feel like running I would start my nike+ watch then think forget this I'm stopping or I'm not running anymore I'm just gonna walk. I would remember the next time I logged it it would say Tera's last run was .10 miles or Tera's last run was 2 miles and took 35 minutes.  I didn't want the whole world to see when I was lazy and slacking, so in the end I would suck it up and run anyways knowing my nike+ watch would tell on me if I didn't.

I don't know what's wrong with designers & clothiers these days, but they are sure making crap. Those of us who can't afford a new wardrobe every season need to revolt.

So I contacted Nike customer service. Now, most companies will simply replace defective product.  Not Nike.

Review after review complained about the squeak in these shoes. It\\'s pretty obvious to me that Nike couldn\\'t care less about this negative feedback or they would have addressed the issue long ago.Needless to say, I\\'ve given up on the Nike brand entirely, and the only consolation for all my wasted time and money is to be able to tell everyone my Nike squeak story and to tell them that IMO, Nike has become a third rate company.  I would strongly recommend you avoid Nike, until they stop selling products they (should) know are defective, and stop ignoring customer complaints.BTW, I finally went back to the out-of-town retailer where I purchased them and they replaced them - with another pair that squeaks even worse.

Everyday it seems like it is slowly getting worse, and I fear this pair will not even get close to lasting a year.What is not as annoying as a loose thong sandal, though very disappointing, is something aesthetically wrong with a Nike product.

She can hardly do any exercise involving running or cycling as a result.When she tried to contact the store, they said no refunds or replacements. When she tried to contact Nike customer services, they fobbed her off by telling her to go back to the store. The email responses were anonymous. None of the phone numbers in the email worked (one was a sex line in the USA, the others either didn't connect or played a message saying that they were busy).And there was no acknowledgement or concern that their product had wrecked her sports career.BEWARE - AVOID NIKE PRODUCTS! They are no good for serious sports play (at the amateur level, that is). Their sports shoes are merely fashion products aimed at gullible consumers. No self-respecting sports professional would use Nike products unless they have been paid to do so, or more likely it's because they don't get the same gear that is sold in the stores to ordinary consumers.NIKE PRODUCTS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS AND LONG-LASTING MUSCLE INJURIES.AVOID\", 'I wore these shoes twice and my feet were in pain the entire time.

I concluded that these shoes are meant to be worn without socks: 1) Their hard to put on with socks on. 2) Their too tight with socks on. 3) They're easier to put on without socks. 4) The opening of the shoe looks to be an imitation of an ankle sock.
